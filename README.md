# weather-forecast
For this project I created a weather forecast site. Using bootstrap, JS, CSS and HTML, I made a functional website that searches an API for any searched location. It also stores past searches for easy navigation. Deviating from the assignment README, I made it into a "night mode" for readability, but also a personal preference.
